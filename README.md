This project uses 2020–2021 consumer spending and employment data from the Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker to forecast employment levels through 2025. The goal is to test whether relationships observed during the pandemic remain predictive in later years. The model captures partial predictive power (MAE ≈ 0.07), highlighting how structural changes in the economy reduce the stability of early-pandemic signals.
